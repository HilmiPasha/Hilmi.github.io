								<h3><a href="#">Assignment 1</a></h3>

								<h3><a href="#">Assignment 2</a></h3>
							</header>
							<p>In this assignment, my team and I went to UTM Digital to take a peek at what goes behind the scene of UTM's services like their email service centre, how their system operates, and even their latest work that is in progress. This task has taught me that the system
								 that are currently available and is being used, goes through alot of processes and tests. Same goes to progress in real life, we need many experiences and tests. Whether it fails or it succeeded, it is all important for our growth as humans, shaping us further into what we are now.

							<p>In this assignment, we were given a video of an industry talk by uhammad Habibullah bin Mohd Nizam, he
								graduated from UTM in 2005, he has accumulated extensive experience in alot of technologies related stuff. 
								
								What I learned from this industry talk is how to be successful in my major for the next four years, what I am going to do is
								 I will build on my strong foundation of balancing academics, personal projects, 
								 and technical skills, such as my experience in system design and app development.</p>

								<h3><a href="#">Assignment 4</a></h3>
							</header>
							<p>In this assignment, we visited MaGICX, it is a company by UTM that focuses on gamification and enrichment of digital content. Here we learned the current technologies that are used for solving problems and helping us to be more efficient on working with certain things. We also learned the problems that are
								available and being solved right now in the seminar. We learned that technologies like AR and VR are not only great for games but also amazingly helpful for solving problems in real life.

								<h3><a href="#">My Group's Project</a></h3>
							</header>
							<p>In this project my group and I made an All In One Medical app which is called "HealthSphere", this app will provide many amazing features like live consult with an experienced doctor, Quick and safe medicine order and delivery, and also accurate summary for the illness that the patient have. Ofcourse we have many more features available, but it is going to be long to write it one by one.
								This project has taught me many things like leadership, the importance of time managing, and also that good communication goes a long way. While making the app is fun and such a great experience, it is also challanging because there are many layers that goes into the process. Like thinking what the design is going to be like to actually designing it while also making it to function properly.
								Overall the project that we made succeeded, but improvements are absolutely needed.</p>

							<h2><a href="#">More about me!</a></h2>
							<p>
								Hi! I'm Muhammad Hilmi Pasha Pranotosetyo, you can call me Hilmi. I was born in Indonesia, Tangerang to be exact. I am a first year student in UTM majoring in Software Engineering. 
							</p>
						</header>
						<p>
							Ever since I was a kid I alwas were interested in technologies, like how things work and what it consists of. Machine, computers, phones, cameras have alwas been intriguing to me. That is why I chose this major.
							I like to learn new things, especially the technological part of things. The improvements of those things will never end and instead rapidly being replaced by newer and better things. Being in UTM and meeting many different kind of people
							shapes me into a better version of myself. This semester especially, makes me more prepared of what lies ahead with the projects and assigments given. I'm grateful to be here and being given the chance to study and meet many great people that shares the same vision as me.
